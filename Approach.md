# Approach to Brain-Text Transcription Using Neurosity SDK

This document outlines how the project aligns with the Neurosity SDK's concepts of Kinesis and Predictions.

---

## Kinesis for Gesture Recognition

### User-Defined Gesture
- Utilize Kinesis to recognize a specific gesture that signals the start of reading. This could be a hand movement or even a specific thought pattern.

---

## Predictions for Text Generation

### Word Association
- Use the Predictions concept to recognize thought patterns associated with specific words or phrases. This could be trained using a Word Association exercise, as you mentioned.

---

## Additional Considerations

### Data Synchronization
- Ensure that the gesture recognition and word association are well-synchronized to initiate the reading and writing process seamlessly.

### Model Training
- Both Kinesis and Predictions will require substantial data collection and machine learning model training to achieve accurate results.

### User Feedback
- Implement a feedback mechanism to refine the model based on user experience.
