### TensorFlow_JS_Capabilities.md

# TensorFlow.js Capabilities Relevant to this Project

This document discusses the capabilities of TensorFlow.js that are particularly relevant to this project's goals.

## Custom Models
- TensorFlow.js allows for the creation of custom models tailored to specific needs.

## Real-time Inference
- Supports real-time data inference, essential for interpreting EEG data on-the-fly.

## Integration
- Easily integrates with the Neurosity SDK's Node.js library.

## Transfer Learning
- Fine-tuning of pre-trained models is possible, saving time and computational resources.

## Challenges and Considerations
- **Data Complexity**: Handling of complex and noisy EEG data.
- **Model Interpretability**: Understanding the model's predictions.
- **Computational Resources**: Optimized for both browser and server-side but can be resource-intensive.
- **Data Labeling**: Accurate labeling of brainwave data is crucial.
- **Model Evaluation**: Rigorous evaluation methods must be applied.
- **Ethical Considerations**: Data privacy and security are paramount.
