## Why OpenAPI Wasn't Initially Considered

OpenAPI is not specifically designed for EEG data interpretation or brain-computer interfaces. It is more of a specification for building APIs and doesn't offer pre-trained models or specialized tools for EEG data.

## Potential Utility of OpenAPI

### Standardization
- OpenAPI can help standardize the API endpoints if you're developing a web service around your BCI application.

### Documentation
- OpenAPI can auto-generate documentation, making it easier for other developers to understand your project.

### Client SDK Generation
- OpenAPI can generate client SDKs in various languages, which could be beneficial given your multi-language expertise.

### Interoperability
- OpenAPI ensures that your API will be easily consumable by other services or applications.
