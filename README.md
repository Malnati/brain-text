### Kinesis for Gesture Recognition

#### Start Parsing
- Use a pre-defined gesture to initiate the brainwave parsing process.

---

### User Notification

#### Reading Prompt
- Notify the user to start reading a text on the screen once the parsing begins.

---

### Predictions for Text Generation

#### Word Matching
- Use Predictions to match the parsed brainwave data with words from the text.

---

### Machine Learning

#### Training
- Repeatedly perform this exercise with different texts to train the machine learning model.

---

### Text Generation from Thinking

#### Reverse Process
- Utilize the trained model to generate text directly from thinking.
