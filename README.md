## Overview
This repository contains a project aimed at transcribing brain waves into text. It utilizes the Neurosity SDK's concepts of Kinesis and Predictions for this purpose.

---

### Kinesis for Gesture Recognition
- [Start Parsing](#start-parsing): Use a pre-defined gesture to initiate the brainwave parsing process.

---

### User Notification
- [Reading Prompt](#reading-prompt): Notify the user to start reading a text on the screen once the parsing begins.

---

### Predictions for Text Generation
- [Word Matching](#word-matching): Use Predictions to match the parsed brainwave data with words from the text.

---

### Machine Learning
- [Training](#training): Repeatedly perform this exercise with different texts to train the machine learning model.

---

### Text Generation from Thinking
- [Reverse Process](#reverse-process): Utilize the trained model to generate text directly from thinking.
