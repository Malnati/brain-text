# Docker Development Environment Setup

## Introduction

This guide aims to help you set up a Docker development environment for your NodeJS application. By following these steps, you'll be able to develop your application within a Docker container, avoiding the need to install dependencies on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop installed on your MacBook Air M2
- Visual Studio Code installed
- Git installed

## Step 1: Initialize Docker Dev Environment

1. **Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory.**

    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/project
    ```

2. **Create a Dockerfile for your development environment.**

    ```bash
    touch Dockerfile-DevEnvironment
    ```

    Open the Dockerfile-DevEnvironment in a text editor and add the following content:

    ```Dockerfile
    # Use an official Node runtime as base image
    FROM node:14

    # Set the working directory in the container
    WORKDIR /usr/src/app

    # Install app dependencies
    COPY package*.json ./
    RUN npm install

    # Copy the current directory contents into the container
    COPY . .
    ```

3. **Create a `docker-compose.yaml` file.**

    ```bash
    touch docker-compose.yaml
    ```

    Open the `docker-compose.yaml` in a text editor and add the following content:

    ```yaml
    version: "3.7"
    services:
      app:
        build:
          context: .
          dockerfile: Dockerfile-DevEnvironment
        ports:
          - "3000:3000"
    ```

## Step 2: Launch VSCode Dev Environment

1. **Open Docker Desktop.**

    Navigate to the Dev Environments tab.

2. **Create a New Dev Environment.**

    Click on the "New Environment" button and select your project directory where the `docker-compose.yaml` and `Dockerfile-DevEnvironment` are located.

3. **Launch VSCode.**

    Once the environment is created, click on the "Open in VSCode" button. This will launch Visual Studio Code with the remote container extension, connecting it to your Docker container.

---

## Step 3: Install Dependencies Inside Docker Container

1. **Open Terminal in VSCode.**

    Once VSCode is connected to your Docker container, open a new terminal window inside VSCode. This terminal will be running inside your Docker container.

2. **Install Dependencies.**

    Run the following command to install the dependencies specified in your `package.json`:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Example Output After Installing Dependencies

After running the `npm install` command in the terminal within VSCode, you may see the following output:

```bash
root@01b443cf3002:/com.docker.devenvironments.code# npm install
npm notice created a lockfile as package-lock.json. You should commit this file.
npm WARN brain-text@1.0.0 No repository field.
npm WARN brain-text@1.0.0 No license field.

found 0 vulnerabilities

root@01b443cf3002:/com.docker.devenvironments.code#
```

## Step 4: Publish Docker Image to Docker Hub (Optional)

### Advantages

- Version control for your Docker images.
- Easy accessibility for collaboration.
- Automated builds linked to your GitHub repository.

### Procedure

1. Log in to your Docker Hub account.

    ```bash
    docker login
    ```

2. Tag your Docker image.

    ```bash
    docker tag local-image-name:tagname new-repo-name:tagname
    ```

3. Push the Docker image to your Docker Hub repository.

    ```bash
    docker push new-repo-name:tagname
    ```

Example output after pushing the image:

```bash
The push refers to repository [docker.io/new-repo-name/tagname]
...
```

## Step 5: Build Neurosity NodeJS App

1. **Follow the Neurosity Tutorial.**

    At this point, you can proceed to follow the steps in the Neurosity tutorial to build your NodeJS app. Since you are working within a Docker container, all dependencies and files will be isolated from your local environment.

---

## Step 6: Share Dev Environment

1. **Generate Shareable Link.**

    Go back to Docker Desktop and navigate to the Dev Environments tab. Select your environment and click on the "Share" button. This will generate a shareable link similar to `https://open.docker.com/dashboard/dev-envs?url=https://`.

2. **Update GitHub Repository.**

    Add this shareable link to your GitHub repository, specifically in the `docker-environment.md`, to allow others to easily access and set up the same development environment.
