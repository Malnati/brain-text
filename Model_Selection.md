# Model Selection for Brain-Text Transcription

This document outlines the rationale behind selecting a specific machine learning model for the task of transcribing brain waves into text using the Neurosity SDK's concepts of Kinesis and Predictions.

## Recommended Models: RNN or LSTM

### Why RNN or LSTM?

1. **Sequence Modeling**: Both Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs) excel at modeling sequences, making them ideal for interpreting time-series EEG data.

2. **Memory**: LSTMs possess a 'memory' feature that retains past information, beneficial for understanding the context within EEG data.

3. **Real-time Processing**: These models are capable of real-time data processing, essential for applications requiring immediate feedback.

4. **Flexibility**: RNNs and LSTMs can be fine-tuned to meet the specific requirements of this project, such as recognizing particular gestures or thought patterns.

### Additional Considerations

Given the complexity and uniqueness of brain wave data, experimentation with different architectures and hyperparameters will likely be necessary to identify the most effective model for this specific application.
