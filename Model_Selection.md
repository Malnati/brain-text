# Model Selection for Brain-Text Transcription

This document outlines the rationale behind selecting a specific machine learning model for the task of transcribing brain waves into text using the Neurosity SDK's concepts of Kinesis and Predictions.

## Recommended Models: RNN or LSTM

### Why RNN or LSTM?

1. **Sequence Modeling**: Both Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs) excel at modeling sequences, making them ideal for interpreting time-series EEG data.

2. **Memory**: LSTMs possess a 'memory' feature that retains past information, beneficial for understanding the context within EEG data.

3. **Real-time Processing**: These models are capable of real-time data processing, essential for applications requiring immediate feedback.

4. **Flexibility**: RNNs and LSTMs can be fine-tuned to meet the specific requirements of this project, such as recognizing particular gestures or thought patterns.

### Additional Considerations

Given the complexity and uniqueness of brain wave data, experimentation with different architectures and hyperparameters will likely be necessary to identify the most effective model for this specific application.

## Experimentation Plan

### Steps for Effective Experimentation

1. **Data Collection**: Gather a diverse set of EEG data using the Neurosity SDK. Ensure accurate labeling.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Normalize and clean the data. Segment it into epochs for easier analysis.
3. **Model Architecture**: Start with basic RNN or LSTM models and gradually experiment with more complex architectures.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use techniques like grid search or random search to tune learning rate, batch size, and other hyperparameters.
5. **Training and Validation**: Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. Train and validate the model accordingly.
6. **Evaluation Metrics**: Choose metrics like accuracy, F1 score, or custom metrics relevant to your problem.
7. **Iterative Refinement**: Refine the model based on performance metrics and retrain.
8. **User Testing**: Validate the model's real-world applicability through user testing.
9. **Documentation**: Keep records of each experiment, including architecture, hyperparameters, and performance metrics.

### Tools and Libraries

- **TensorBoard**: For monitoring the training process.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For interactive data analysis and prototyping.
- **Git**: For version control.
