## Metrics in Neurosity SDK

### Kinesis
- This metric is generally used for motion-related applications. It interprets brain signals to control physical or virtual objects, making it suitable for applications like prosthetic control or gaming.

### Predictions
- This is a more generalized term and could refer to any predictive model applied to the brain data. It could be used for forecasting mood, attention levels, or even specific thoughts.

### Focus
- This metric measures the user's level of concentration. It's often used in productivity apps to determine the best times for work or breaks.

### Calm
- This metric gauges the user's level of relaxation or calmness. It's commonly used in meditation or mental well-being applications to provide real-time feedback.

## Relevance to Project
Given the project's aim to transcribe brain waves into text, "Predictions" might be the most relevant metric, as it could potentially be tailored to predict specific thoughts or words.
