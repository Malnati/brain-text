# Gesture Recognition Capabilities and Limitations with Neurosity SDK and The Crown Device

This document focuses on the types of gestures that can be implemented using the Neurosity SDK with The Crown device, as well as those that are not feasible for this project.

---

## Feasible Gestures

### Arm Gestures

#### Data Features
- The Crown device can capture EEG patterns that may correlate with arm movements.

#### Machine Learning
- Train a model to recognize these EEG patterns as specific arm gestures.

## Non-Feasible Recognition Types

### Eye Movements and Facial Expressions

The Neurosity SDK and The Crown device are primarily designed for interpreting brainwave data and do not offer direct features for eye movement or facial expression recognition. Therefore, these types of recognition are not considered feasible for this project.

Your MacBook Air M2 should be well-suited for handling the computational requirements for implementing arm gestures.
